   We will work on the dashboard of this application http://localhost:3000/portal/dashboard

   What i need is you to implement the dashboard, navigation, header, footer, login section, logout button as represented in the figma design. Always make this design    
   responsive, since its also used on mobile.                                                                                                                             
   </instructions>                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                          
   <details>                                                                                                                                                              
   there is an existing dashboard, change it following the design.                                                                                                        
   rename the dashboard to orders - also its route, since the dashboard=order overview page.                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                          
   add a dynamic breadcrumb.                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                          
   add a navigation as its in the design - add static pages for the pages linked in the navigation.                                                                       
   add static data into that

   make the order table filterable in the header of this table i.e. in column order number, it allows be to input a order number and it filters the table (table rows)    
   using javascript for this order number.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                          
   add pagination to that table.                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                          
   create 30 static rows with example data following the table header description.

   add resuable compoenents and variables if possible. if you find anything that need to be refactored, refactor it. always follow figma design and its variables.
